# Processing WGS data with ASCAT
Although we recommend running [Battenberg](https://github.com/Wedge-lab/battenberg) on WGS data to get accurate clonal and subclonal allele-specific copy-number alteration calls, ASCAT can still be used to get a fast ploidy/purity estimate. To this end, we pre-generated a set of loci, alongside with GC content and replication timing correction files.

Briefly, such a list was derived from 1000 Genomes Project SNPs ([hg19](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/), [hg38](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000_genomes_project/release/20190312_biallelic_SNV_and_INDEL/) and for [T2T-CHM13](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/index.html?prefix=T2T/CHM13/assemblies/variants/1000_Genomes_Project/chm13v2.0/unrelated_samples_2504/)):

- Biallelic SNPs with allele frequency higher than 0.35 and lower than 0.65 in any population were selected using *BCFtools*.
- Duplicated entries were removed using *R*.
- SNPs located in the [ENCODE blacklisted regions](https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/) were discarded.
- SNPs with noisy BAF (distant from 0/0.5/1) in normal samples (a.k.a probloci) as part of the [Battenberg](https://github.com/Wedge-lab/battenberg) package were discarded (*probloci_270415.txt.gz* for hg19 and *probloci.zip* for hg38). For T2T-CHM13, a lifted over version, form the GRCh38 to T2T, of the problematic loci identified by Battenberg were discarded.

Since hg38 data for the non-PAR region of chrX is not available (as of September 2021), hg38 data for the whole chrX comes from a lift-over from hg19.

GC content and replication timing correction files were then generated using scripts provided in the *[LogRcorrection](../../LogRcorrection)* folder.

### File format

#### Loci file
One file per chromosome, no header, the first column is the chromosome name and the second column is the position.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 10642 |
| 1 | 11008 |
| 1 | 11012 |

#### Allele file
One file per chromosome, one header, the first column is the position and the second and third columns are reference and alternate nucleotides with the following conversion: A=1, C=2, G=3 and T=4.

| position | a0 | a1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10642 | 3 | 1 |
| 11008 | 2 | 3 |
| 11012 | 2 | 3 |

In the example above, SNP at position 10642 is G>A and SNPs at 11008 and 11012 are both C>G.

#### GC correction file
One single file, one header, the first column is the SNP ID, the second/third columns are chromosome/position and the other columns are GC% around SNPs with different window sizes.

| | Chr | Position | 25bp | 50bp | 100bp | 200bp | 500bp | 1kb | 2kb | 5kb | 10kb | 20kb | 50kb | 100kb | 200kb | 500kb | 1Mb |

### 'chr'-based versus non 'chr'-based reference

Please note that loci files provided above are not 'chr'-based (chromosome names are '1', '2', '3', etc. and not 'chr1', 'chr2', 'chr3', etc.). If your BAMs are 'chr'-based, you will need to add 'chr' (Bash: `for i in {1..22} X; do sed -i 's/^/chr/' G1000_loci_hg19_chr${i}.txt; done`). ASCAT will internally remove 'chr' so the other files (allele, GC correction and RT correction) should not be modified and `chrom_names` (`ascat.prepareHTS`) should be `c(1:22,'X')`.
